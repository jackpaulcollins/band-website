    <p class="column">“A little bit Josh Ritter, a little bit Modest Mouse, the Weather Machine forges a stable relationship between contemporary folk-pop and more traditional pop-rock sensibilities, and are one of the current flag-bearers of the sound in Portland.” – Willamette Week</p>
    <p class="column">“Bigger, louder, and more dynamic than their debut, and they've never sounded better” – Portland Mercury</p>
    <p class="column">“Capable of channeling a soaring energy through their performances” – PASTE Magazine</p>

      <p>The Weather Machine’s sophomore full-length, Peach, was recorded over the course of two years, and showcases the band’s transition from folk-born storytelling into the realm powerballads and effects pedals. It’s not quite “tongue and cheek,” but Peach makes the listener wonder as it pits a not-quite-country anthem called “Wannabe Cowboys” right up against the electronic slow-jam title track, then moves deftly along into “Breakup Song” – a tune worthy of high-kicking chorus lines. They’ve drawn comparisons to everything from My Morning Jacket to Cake.</p>
